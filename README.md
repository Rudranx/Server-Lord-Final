**Server Lord** is a high-performance, scalable cron job monitoring platform that provides **real-time tracking**, **failure detection**, and **observability** for scheduled background tasks.

> ⚙ Built with **Golang**, **PostgreSQL (sharded)**, and **OpenTelemetry**  
> 🧠 Handles over **100,000 tasks** with <250ms shard-level latency

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Backend       | Golang (Goroutines, Fiber)   |
| Database      | PostgreSQL with Citus Sharding |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry                |
| Frontend      | Next.js (optional UI layer)  |
| Architecture  | Semaphore-based concurrency  |

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Multi-user heartbeat monitoring
- 🧵 Concurrency-safe tracking using semaphores

## 🏗️ Monitoring Workflow

flowchart LR
    A[Cron Job Heartbeat] --> B[Server Listener]
    B --> C{Is Heartbeat Timely?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Update Task Timestamp]
    C -- No --> E[Log Failure & Alert]
    D --> F[Metrics Exported to Telemetry]
    E --> F

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Rudranx/Server-Lord-Final.git
cd Server-Lord-Final
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure Go v1.18+ is installed:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_NAME=serverlord_db
SHARD_COUNT=4
```

> Use `.env` + `godotenv` for loading environment variables.

### 4️⃣ Run the Server

```bash
go run main.go
```

## 🧪 Performance Testing

| Metric             | Result                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Users              | 10,000                                        |
| Tasks              | 100,000                                       |
| Monitoring Latency | <250ms per shard                              |
| DB Load            | Significantly reduced after push model switch |

## 📈 Observability with OpenTelemetry

You can visualize metrics using:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Go App] -->|Export Metrics| B[OpenTelemetry Collector]
    B --> C[Prometheus/Grafana]
```

> This pipeline tracks latency, task failures, and DB timings.
